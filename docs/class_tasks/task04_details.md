## Task 4: Becoming a databender 
### Background 
You just started your internship at a big firm in New York, and your manager gave you an extensive file of flights that departed JFK, LGA, or EWR in 2013. From this data (`install.packages(nycflights13)`) your manager wants you to answer the following questions;

1. If I am leaving before noon, what are my top two airline options at each airport (JFK, LGA, EWR) that will have the least amount of delay time?
2. Which origin airport is best to minimize my chances of a late arrival when I am using Delta Airlines?
3. Which destination airport is the worst airport for arrival time?

Make sure to include visualizations to provide context for the answers.

I made up databending.  It does not mean that we make up data or that we alter it.  Like [airbenders](http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Airbending){target="blank"} we control our data to answer the questions we need answered.  The key to databending is flexibility and finding and following the path of least resistence.
