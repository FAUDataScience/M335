## Task 15: My investment is better than yours 
### Background 

The stock market is overflowing with data.  There are many packages in R that allow us to get quick access to information on publicly traded companies.  Imagine that you and a friend each purchased about $1,000 of stock in three different stocks at the start of October last year, and you want to compare your performance.  Use the stock shares purchased and share prices to demonstrate how each of you fared assuming that did not change your allocations.
