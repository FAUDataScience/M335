## Task 13:  How is the weather? 
### Background 

Use the `library(weatherdata)` package that is described [here](http://ram-n.github.io/weatherData/){target="blank"} and get the month of June for 2015, 2016, and 2017. You would use `getWeatherForDate(opt_detailed = TRUE, opt_temperature_columns = FALSE, opt_all_columns = TRUE)` for station `KRXE`.  We have a few coding tasks to help us get used to using dates. Create a visualization for each question.

1. What day of the week had the highest temperature reading?
2. What day of the week had the lowest temperature at 2 pm?
