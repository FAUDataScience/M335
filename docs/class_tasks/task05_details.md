## Task 5: World Data Investigation 
### Background 

The [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/){target="blank"} website has world data.  It is nice that they have provided graphics and then the data that they used to generate the graphics. We are going to recreate some of their visualizations in R and then make them better.

* [ ] Review the [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/){target="blank"} webpage and find a graphic that interests you.
    * [ ] Recreate that graphic in R after downloading the data from their website
    * [ ] Find some interesting features on your graphic. Then do some reasearch online to find out the cause of that feature for an annotation that you can add to your plot.
    * [ ] Use a [clean way](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/annotate.html) to add the information from the online search to your graphic
* [ ] Explore the world data on `child_mortality` and create an interesting graphic that highlights this dataset.
    * [ ] Use `devtools::install_github("drsimonj/ourworldindata") to get a larger dataset on `child_mortality`
    * [ ] Create a graphic that you could use in a final presentation to summarize world child mortatility
* [ ] Include your plots in an `.Rmd` file with short paragraph describing your plots
* [ ] Push your `.Rmd`, `.md`, and `.html` to your GitHub repo
