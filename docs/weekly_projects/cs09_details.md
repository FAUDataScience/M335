## Case Study 9: Get your project moving 
### Background 

This week we will learn new coding techniques and visualization principles.  However, your case study and weekly tasks will provide time to makes sure you have wrapped up the first two tasks of the [semester project](https://byuistats.github.io/M335/project.html).
