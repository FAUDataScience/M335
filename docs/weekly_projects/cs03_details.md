## Case Study 3: Reducing Gun Deaths (FiveThirtyEight) 
### Background 

The world is a dangerous place.  During 2015 and 2016 there was a lot of discussion in the [news about police shootings](http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/controversial-police-shootings/){target="blank"}.  [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/){target="blank"} reported on [gun deaths in 2016](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths/){target="blank"}.  As leaders in data journalism they have posted a [clean version of this data](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data){target="blank"} for us to use. Their visualizations focused on yearly averages.  

Our client wants to create commercials that help reduce the gun deaths in the US.  They would like to target the commercials to different seasons of the year (think month variable). Our challenge is to summarize and visualize seasonal trends in these data.
